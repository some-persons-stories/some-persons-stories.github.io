# What is this?
I'm a real person.
I have some weird stories.

I'm going to be extremely revealing with these, so please don't dox me or something if you do figure out who I am.
It's met to be entertaining.
A lot of people tell me 'you should write a book' when I start talking about my stories.

I will embellish some of these to make it more entertaining for you.
This isn't therapy for me, its entertainment written for people on the internet.
I'm probably going to make a thing that somehow publishes this all to this site with emacs org mode.
I don't know.
We'll start.

There may eventually be a useless but interesting software project that develops from this.
